# Alterations in glial cell function can impact neuronal function and plasticity. Glial cells support and modulate the activity of neurons, including their synaptic connections and transmission.
# The GlialCellFunctionAlterations class has two parameters: modulation_rate and learning_rate. The primary function, update_glial_modulation, updates the glial modulation level based on the modulation rate, learning rate, and activity level. Random noise is added to the activity level, and the sigmoid activation function is applied to it. This helps maintain a level of complexity while still being computationally efficient.
