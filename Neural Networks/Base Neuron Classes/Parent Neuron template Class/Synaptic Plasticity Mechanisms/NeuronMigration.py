# The updated NeuronMigration class now includes a learning rate parameter. The primary function, update_position, adjusts the neuron position based on migration speed, random noise, and learning rate. The neuron position is updated by adding learning_rate * activity_level * migration_speed * noise. The learning rate modulates the impact of migration speed on the neuron position update, and the activity level represents the current activity of the neuron, which can influence the migration process.
