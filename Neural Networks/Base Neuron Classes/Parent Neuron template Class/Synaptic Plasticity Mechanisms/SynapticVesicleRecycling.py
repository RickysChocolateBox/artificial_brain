# Synaptic vesicle recycling is the process by which vesicles are reused after neurotransmitter release. This process ensures efficient communication between neurons and is essential for maintaining proper synaptic function.
# The SynapticVesicleRecycling class has two parameters: recycling_rate and learning_rate. The primary function, update_vesicle_recycling, updates the vesicle count based on the recycling rate, learning rate, and activity level. Random noise is added to the activity level, and the sigmoid activation function is applied to it. This helps maintain a level of complexity while still being computationally efficient.
