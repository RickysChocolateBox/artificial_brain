# Neuronal excitability changes involve modifications in the membrane properties of a neuron that affect its ability to generate action potentials. These changes can result from alterations in ion channel expression or function, among other factors.
# The NeuronalExcitabilityChanges class has two parameters: excitability_rate and learning_rate. The primary function, update_excitability, updates the excitability level based on the excitability rate, learning rate, and activity level. Random noise is added to the activity level, and the sigmoid activation function is applied to it. This helps maintain a level of complexity while still being computationally efficient.
