# Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins play a crucial role in regulating neuronal function and plasticity. PTMs can alter protein function, localization, and interaction with other proteins or molecules.
# The PostTranslationalModifications class has two parameters: ptm_rate and learning_rate. The primary function, update_ptm_level, updates the PTM level based on the ptm rate, learning rate, and activity level. Random noise is added to the activity level, and the sigmoid activation function is applied to it. This helps maintain a level of complexity while still being computationally efficient.
