# The Myelination class has two parameters: myelin_rate and learning_rate. The primary function, update_myelin_thickness, updates the myelin thickness based on the myelin rate, learning rate, and neuronal activity level. The myelin thickness is increased by adding the product of the learning rate, myelin rate, and activity level.
