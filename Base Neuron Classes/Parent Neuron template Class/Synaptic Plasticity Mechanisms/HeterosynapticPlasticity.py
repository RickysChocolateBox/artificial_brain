# This class represents the mechanism of heterosynaptic plasticity. The primary function, update_plasticity, updates the heterosynaptic plasticity state based on the activity level and random noise. The plasticity_state is increased or decreased according to the plasticity_rate depending on whether the activity level is above or below the modulation_threshold. The sigmoid function is used as the activation function.
