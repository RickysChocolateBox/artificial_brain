# This class represents the mechanism of alterations in neurotransmitter release. The primary function, update_release, adjusts the release amount of neurotransmitters based on the activity level and random noise. If the activity level is above the modulation_threshold, the release amount is increased. Otherwise, it is decreased. The sigmoid function is used as the activation function.
