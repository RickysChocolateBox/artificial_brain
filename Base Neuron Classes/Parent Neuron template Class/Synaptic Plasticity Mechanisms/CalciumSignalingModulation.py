# Calcium signaling plays a critical role in various aspects of neuronal function and plasticity. Modulation of calcium signaling can impact synaptic strength, gene expression, and other cellular processes.
# The CalciumSignalingModulation class has two parameters: modulation_rate and learning_rate. The primary function, update_calcium_modulation, updates the calcium modulation level based on the modulation rate, learning rate, and activity level. Random noise is added to the activity level, and the sigmoid activation function is applied to it. This helps maintain a level of complexity while still being computationally efficient.
